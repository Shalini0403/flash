PROMPT TEMPLATE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an educational assistant that reads study material and creates flashcards to help students remember key facts.

Your task: **generate concise, varied flashcards** in valid JSON format.

Each flashcard must have:
- "front": a short question or prompt (≤120 characters)
- "back": a list of 1–4 short bullets (each ≤1 line)
- "hint": a brief clue if possible (optional but preferred)

Format your final output strictly as:
{{
  "cards": [
    {{
      "front": "...",
      "back": ["...", "..."],
      "hint": "..."
    }},
    ...
  ]
}}

Return only JSON — no extra commentary.

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. It occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells. The process requires carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight. The main product is glucose, and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Photosynthesis has two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle.

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. DNA is made up of molecules called nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains a phosphate group, a sugar group and a nitrogen base. The four types of nitrogen bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C). DNA replication is the process by which DNA makes a copy of itself during cell division.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first five prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. Pi (π) is approximately 3.14159 and represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.

Python lists are mutable, ordered collections that can contain mixed data types. Lists are created using square brackets. Common list methods include append(), remove(), pop(), and sort(). List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Example: [x**2 for x in range(10)] creates a list of squares.

Capitalism is an economic system based on private ownership and free markets. Socialism involves collective or government ownership of production means. In capitalism, prices are determined by supply and demand. In socialism, the government often controls prices. Capitalism encourages competition, while socialism emphasizes equality.

Water (H2O) is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. It has a boiling point of 100°C at sea level. Water is a polar molecule, meaning it has a slight positive charge on one end and a slight negative charge on the other. This polarity allows water to dissolve many substances, earning it the title 'universal solvent'.

Mitosis is the process of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells. It consists of four main phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. During prophase, chromosomes condense and become visible. In metaphase, chromosomes align at the cell's center. During anaphase, sister chromatids separate. In telophase, two nuclei form.

The Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the late 18th century. Key inventions included the steam engine by James Watt (1769), the spinning jenny by James Hargreaves (1764), and the power loom by Edmund Cartwright (1785). The revolution led to urbanization, factory systems, and significant social changes. Working conditions were often harsh, leading to labor movements.
