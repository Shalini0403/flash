This is called patrilineal descent. There are also matrilineal societies Garo, Khasi and Pahadi in the northeast, and Nayar, Mappilla, Lakshadweep islanders, and several tribal and 'nontribal groups in south India in which descent is traced in the mother's line. Besides these two main systems, there are also examples of cognatic communities- Anglo-Indians and some tribal groups which have bilateral tendencies. They may take the name from the father but in tracing descent they also take note of the mother's line. Alongside the words patrilineal and matrilineal, there is a tendency to use also Patriarchal and Matriarchal. The latter usage is loose and confusing. Patriarchy refers to male dominant structures and this indeed is the norm in a sizeable part of Indian society. But matriarchy (female dominant system) does not exist. Women in matrilineal groups are important but in several fields they are not the effective decision makers. Major management functions are vested in male members. There is considerable variation in pattern of residence after marri age. When the wife moves to live in her husband's father's house (or grandfather's or uncle's house, in the event of father not being there) the family type is patrilocal. Conversely, when the husband moves to live with his wife's mother's family, the famil y type is matrilocal. P atrilocal residence is the most comm on in India; examples of matrilocal residence are found am ong the Khasi, the Nayar, and several other matrilineal groups. In a number of tribal groups a neolocal residence (a new house for the newly wedded couple) is preferred, although it is more commo n for them to set up a new home after a period of stay in a partilocal or matrilocal setting. In Lakshadweep and central Kerala the approved pattern of residence is duolocal the husband continuing to live in his mother's Tarawad and the wife in her mother's Tarawad. India is often described as a country of joint famil ies. In social anthropological and sociological literature this term is less comm only used; a d istinction is made between the nuclear and extended family - the latter signifying units commonly referred to as the joint famil y. A nuclear famil y means a married couple and their children. An extended family, on the other hand is a larger group composed of two, three, or more generations of lineally related member their spouses, and children. In matrilineal extended famil ies the husbands of marri ed women are not included. At a given point of time the proportion of nuclear famil ies is higher, but most nuclear families grow into extended famil ies and break up later into incomplete extended families or nuclear famil ies. It is rare to find all or even most, members of two or three generations living together. There are evident limits to the number of persons sharing the same house; domestic discord often leads to the setting up of separate units. The latter are referred to as domestic groups of households.

They gradually come to have separate hearths (chulhas) and have independent arrangements for cooking and dining A form of jointness is maintained where nuclear families live and w ork separately, but where there is no formal division of ancestral property, all the members congregate on occasions of marri age and death as well as important ceremonial occasions, Togetherness and solidarity within the famil y are much lauded virtues, but households are not without their politics and intractable problems. Kinship denotes to recognition of relatives either through a blood relationship (technically ca lled consanguinity) or through marriage (in the language of anthropology and sociology called affinity) The relatives, as a class, have a special status; as already n oted, elaborate rules provide appropriate attitudes and stand ards of behavior towards them. These rules cover protection, affection care and concern, familiarity (joking relations), avoidance (of physical, s peech, or visual contact), deference, respect, intervention, and obedience. Kinship also has important social, economic, and political roles. The assertion that in modern industrial society the centrality of kinship has been eroded is, at best only partially correct. The entire range of kinship ties may not now be as important as they once used to be, but it cannot be denied that they have an important supportive or corrective role in social, economic, and political spheres. Rules of descent, residence, and inheritance have been discussed in the context of the family. Further elaboration of them will be tedious and only of academic interest. It is necessary, however, to distinguish between the broad features of kinship in northern and southern India and to comment briefly on some special cases.

The first two are exogamous, but the jati is endogamous. A man is not expected to marry in the Gotra of his father, mother, father's mother and mother's mother. Identity, Status, and property are transmitted in the male line. Members of the lineage cooperate in rituals and ceremonies, and indeed, in some major economic activities. But the group can also be characterized by conflicts and feuds th at may run from generation to generation. On specified occasions there is an exchange of gifts among different categories of kin and affines, but there is so much local, regional, and jati variation on this matter that it is impossible even to sketch them in a brief narrative. The most important feature here is that, among those who are closely related, marri age is strictly prohibited. The rule of village/territorial exogamy, in some parts, further distances the bride from the bridegroom. The roles of daughters and daughters-in- law are sharply distinguished. In south India the general features are the same, with some important exceptions. Here, patrilineages figure in some commu nities, while matrilineages dominate others. In the latter the mother's brother is the manager and exercises authority. As we have already seen in several groups the preferred unions are those between certain categories of close kincross cousins or a maternal uncle and niece, the latter being a daughter of the man's elder sister. The bride in these cases is famili ar with the family into which she is being married Thus unlike in the north w here bridetakers are superior to b ridegivers, no difference is made between the two in the south. These unions have some definite advant ages; apart from the fact that property rotates between sets of close kin and does not go outside the brides in such a setting are less likely to be illtreated than those in the north, where they are on unfamili ar terrain. In the end let us consider some special cases that puzzle outsiders. In descent, inheritance, and succession, as mentioned earlier, the Khasi of Meghalaya are matrilineal. They have matrilocal residence. In their inheritance system, the youngest daughter- the Kakhadduh- is very speci al: she is the heiress. While the other daughters move out after their marri ages and the birth of one or two children to set up separate household, the youngest daughter continues to live with her mother along with her husband and children. She is the custodian of the rituals and bones of iing (the house). She has a special position in regard to the land. Among the Garo the household is known as the Nok. The daughter chosen to inherit the household and continue it is cal led the Nokma. She has to marry someone from her father's lineage. Her husband is known as a Nokrmo . He inherits the headship (and through it the management) of his wife's Nok after the death of his father-in-law. But before he can do so he has to marry his wife's mother. This is essentially an economic arrangement. It is debatable whether this marriage (between the man and his wife's mother) is ever consummated, but some anthropologists are emphatic that sexual relations do take place between them. The pattern of duolocal residence and visiting husbands in central Kerala in the past, and in the Lakshadweep islands even now, may seem somewhat bizarre to outsiders, but it has worked and is still working. Nayar women could have Nambudiri or Nayar visiting husbands. Distance being long, Nayar husbands could Page | 3 SOCIOLO GY BY PRANAY AGGARW AL IAS GURUKUL Call 99996 937 44 www.ias gurukul.com 7, Basement, Apsara Arcade, near Karol Bagh Metro Station Gate # 7, Karol Bagh, New Delhi not make it to their wives every night, but the Nambudiris had a special privilege. Where land was not in short supply, a Math (residential place) was built for them near the Nayar Tarawad, preferably by the side of a pond or a well. The Nambudiri could not dine with his Nayar wife and children and did not have any physical contact with them during hi s daylong state of ritual purity. In the night he could be affectionate to his children and intimate with his wife. The pattern of duolocal residence still works in the Lakshadweep Island. In kalapani, an island in this group, studied in 196163, 76 percent of the unions were of this type. The island being small, distances to be traversed are manageable and this facilitates the working of the system.

This is called patrilineal descent. There are also matrilineal societies Garo, Khasi and Pahadi in the northeast, and Nayar, Mappilla, Lakshadweep islanders, and several tribal and 'nontribal groups in south India in which descent is traced in the mother's line. Besides these two main systems, there are also examples of cognatic communities- Anglo-Indians and some tribal groups which have bilateral tendencies. They may take the name from the father but in tracing descent they also take note of the mother's line. Alongside the words patrilineal and matrilineal, there is a tendency to use also Patriarchal and Matriarchal. The latter usage is loose and confusing. Patriarchy refers to male dominant structures and this indeed is the norm in a sizeable part of Indian society. But matriarchy (female dominant system) does not exist. Women in matrilineal groups are important but in several fields they are not the effective decision makers. Major management functions are vested in male members. There is considerable variation in pattern of residence after marri age. When the wife moves to live in her husband's father's house (or grandfather's or uncle's house, in the event of father not being there) the family type is patrilocal. Conversely, when the husband moves to live with his wife's mother's family, the famil y type is matrilocal. P atrilocal residence is the most comm on in India; examples of matrilocal residence are found am ong the Khasi, the Nayar, and several other matrilineal groups. In a number of tribal groups a neolocal residence (a new house for the newly wedded couple) is preferred, although it is more commo n for them to set up a new home after a period of stay in a partilocal or matrilocal setting. In Lakshadweep and central Kerala the approved pattern of residence is duolocal the husband continuing to live in his mother's Tarawad and the wife in her mother's Tarawad. India is often described as a country of joint famil ies. In social anthropological and sociological literature this term is less comm only used; a d istinction is made between the nuclear and extended family - the latter signifying units commonly referred to as the joint famil y. A nuclear famil y means a married couple and their children. An extended family, on the other hand is a larger group composed of two, three, or more generations of lineally related member their spouses, and children. In matrilineal extended famil ies the husbands of marri ed women are not included. At a given point of time the proportion of nuclear famil ies is higher, but most nuclear families grow into extended famil ies and break up later into incomplete extended families or nuclear famil ies. It is rare to find all or even most, members of two or three generations living together. There are evident limits to the number of persons sharing the same house; domestic discord often leads to the setting up of separate units. The latter are referred to as domestic groups of households.

They gradually come to have separate hearths (chulhas) and have independent arrangements for cooking and dining A form of jointness is maintained where nuclear families live and w ork separately, but where there is no formal division of ancestral property, all the members congregate on occasions of marri age and death as well as important ceremonial occasions, Togetherness and solidarity within the famil y are much lauded virtues, but households are not without their politics and intractable problems. Kinship denotes to recognition of relatives either through a blood relationship (technically ca lled consanguinity) or through marriage (in the language of anthropology and sociology called affinity) The relatives, as a class, have a special status; as already n oted, elaborate rules provide appropriate attitudes and stand ards of behavior towards them. These rules cover protection, affection care and concern, familiarity (joking relations), avoidance (of physical, s peech, or visual contact), deference, respect, intervention, and obedience. Kinship also has important social, economic, and political roles. The assertion that in modern industrial society the centrality of kinship has been eroded is, at best only partially correct. The entire range of kinship ties may not now be as important as they once used to be, but it cannot be denied that they have an important supportive or corrective role in social, economic, and political spheres. Rules of descent, residence, and inheritance have been discussed in the context of the family. Further elaboration of them will be tedious and only of academic interest. It is necessary, however, to distinguish between the broad features of kinship in northern and southern India and to comment briefly on some special cases.

The first two are exogamous, but the jati is endogamous. A man is not expected to marry in the Gotra of his father, mother, father's mother and mother's mother. Identity, Status, and property are transmitted in the male line. Members of the lineage cooperate in rituals and ceremonies, and indeed, in some major economic activities. But the group can also be characterized by conflicts and feuds th at may run from generation to generation. On specified occasions there is an exchange of gifts among different categories of kin and affines, but there is so much local, regional, and jati variation on this matter that it is impossible even to sketch them in a brief narrative. The most important feature here is that, among those who are closely related, marri age is strictly prohibited. The rule of village/territorial exogamy, in some parts, further distances the bride from the bridegroom. The roles of daughters and daughters-in- law are sharply distinguished. In south India the general features are the same, with some important exceptions. Here, patrilineages figure in some commu nities, while matrilineages dominate others. In the latter the mother's brother is the manager and exercises authority. As we have already seen in several groups the preferred unions are those between certain categories of close kincross cousins or a maternal uncle and niece, the latter being a daughter of the man's elder sister. The bride in these cases is famili ar with the family into which she is being married Thus unlike in the north w here bridetakers are superior to b ridegivers, no difference is made between the two in the south. These unions have some definite advant ages; apart from the fact that property rotates between sets of close kin and does not go outside the brides in such a setting are less likely to be illtreated than those in the north, where they are on unfamili ar terrain. In the end let us consider some special cases that puzzle outsiders. In descent, inheritance, and succession, as mentioned earlier, the Khasi of Meghalaya are matrilineal. They have matrilocal residence. In their inheritance system, the youngest daughter- the Kakhadduh- is very speci al: she is the heiress. While the other daughters move out after their marri ages and the birth of one or two children to set up separate household, the youngest daughter continues to live with her mother along with her husband and children. She is the custodian of the rituals and bones of iing (the house). She has a special position in regard to the land. Among the Garo the household is known as the Nok. The daughter chosen to inherit the household and continue it is cal led the Nokma. She has to marry someone from her father's lineage. Her husband is known as a Nokrmo . He inherits the headship (and through it the management) of his wife's Nok after the death of his father-in-law. But before he can do so he has to marry his wife's mother. This is essentially an economic arrangement. It is debatable whether this marriage (between the man and his wife's mother) is ever consummated, but some anthropologists are emphatic that sexual relations do take place between them. The pattern of duolocal residence and visiting husbands in central Kerala in the past, and in the Lakshadweep islands even now, may seem somewhat bizarre to outsiders, but it has worked and is still working. Nayar women could have Nambudiri or Nayar visiting husbands. Distance being long, Nayar husbands could Page | 3 SOCIOLO GY BY PRANAY AGGARW AL IAS GURUKUL Call 99996 937 44 www.ias gurukul.com 7, Basement, Apsara Arcade, near Karol Bagh Metro Station Gate # 7, Karol Bagh, New Delhi not make it to their wives every night, but the Nambudiris had a special privilege. Where land was not in short supply, a Math (residential place) was built for them near the Nayar Tarawad, preferably by the side of a pond or a well. The Nambudiri could not dine with his Nayar wife and children and did not have any physical contact with them during hi s daylong state of ritual purity. In the night he could be affectionate to his children and intimate with his wife. The pattern of duolocal residence still works in the Lakshadweep Island. In kalapani, an island in this group, studied in 196163, 76 percent of the unions were of this type. The island being small, distances to be traversed are manageable and this facilitates the working of the system.

The first two are exogamous, but the jati is endogamous. A man is not expected to marry in the Gotra of his father, mother, father's mother and mother's mother. Identity, Status, and property are transmitted in the male line. Members of the lineage cooperate in rituals and ceremonies, and indeed, in some major economic activities. But the group can also be characterized by conflicts and feuds th at may run from generation to generation. On specified occasions there is an exchange of gifts among different categories of kin and affines, but there is so much local, regional, and jati variation on this matter that it is impossible even to sketch them in a brief narrative. The most important feature here is that, among those who are closely related, marri age is strictly prohibited. The rule of village/territorial exogamy, in some parts, further distances the bride from the bridegroom. The roles of daughters and daughters-in- law are sharply distinguished. In south India the general features are the same, with some important exceptions. Here, patrilineages figure in some commu nities, while matrilineages dominate others. In the latter the mother's brother is the manager and exercises authority. As we have already seen in several groups the preferred unions are those between certain categories of close kincross cousins or a maternal uncle and niece, the latter being a daughter of the man's elder sister. The bride in these cases is famili ar with the family into which she is being married Thus unlike in the north w here bridetakers are superior to b ridegivers, no difference is made between the two in the south. These unions have some definite advant ages; apart from the fact that property rotates between sets of close kin and does not go outside the brides in such a setting are less likely to be illtreated than those in the north, where they are on unfamili ar terrain. In the end let us consider some special cases that puzzle outsiders. In descent, inheritance, and succession, as mentioned earlier, the Khasi of Meghalaya are matrilineal. They have matrilocal residence. In their inheritance system, the youngest daughter- the Kakhadduh- is very speci al: she is the heiress. While the other daughters move out after their marri ages and the birth of one or two children to set up separate household, the youngest daughter continues to live with her mother along with her husband and children. She is the custodian of the rituals and bones of iing (the house). She has a special position in regard to the land. Among the Garo the household is known as the Nok. The daughter chosen to inherit the household and continue it is cal led the Nokma. She has to marry someone from her father's lineage. Her husband is known as a Nokrmo . He inherits the headship (and through it the management) of his wife's Nok after the death of his father-in-law. But before he can do so he has to marry his wife's mother. This is essentially an economic arrangement. It is debatable whether this marriage (between the man and his wife's mother) is ever consummated, but some anthropologists are emphatic that sexual relations do take place between them. The pattern of duolocal residence and visiting husbands in central Kerala in the past, and in the Lakshadweep islands even now, may seem somewhat bizarre to outsiders, but it has worked and is still working. Nayar women could have Nambudiri or Nayar visiting husbands. Distance being long, Nayar husbands could Page | 3 SOCIOLO GY BY PRANAY AGGARW AL IAS GURUKUL Call 99996 937 44 www.ias gurukul.com 7, Basement, Apsara Arcade, near Karol Bagh Metro Station Gate # 7, Karol Bagh, New Delhi not make it to their wives every night, but the Nambudiris had a special privilege. Where land was not in short supply, a Math (residential place) was built for them near the Nayar Tarawad, preferably by the side of a pond or a well. The Nambudiri could not dine with his Nayar wife and children and did not have any physical contact with them during hi s daylong state of ritual purity. In the night he could be affectionate to his children and intimate with his wife. The pattern of duolocal residence still works in the Lakshadweep Island. In kalapani, an island in this group, studied in 196163, 76 percent of the unions were of this type. The island being small, distances to be traversed are manageable and this facilitates the working of the system.

There are also matrilineal societies Garo, Khasi and Pahadi in the northeast, and Nayar, Mappilla, Lakshadweep islanders, and several tribal and 'nontribal groups in south India in which descent is traced in the mother's line. Besides these two main systems, there are also examples of cognatic communities- Anglo-Indians and some tribal groups which have bilateral tendencies. They may take the name from the father but in tracing descent they also take note of the mother's line. Alongside the words patrilineal and matrilineal, there is a tendency to use also Patriarchal and Matriarchal. The latter usage is loose and confusing. Patriarchy refers to male dominant structures and this indeed is the norm in a sizeable part of Indian society. But matriarchy (female dominant system) does not exist. Women in matrilineal groups are important but in several fields they are not the effective decision makers. Major management functions are vested in male members. There is considerable variation in pattern of residence after marri age. When the wife moves to live in her husband's father's house (or grandfather's or uncle's house, in the event of father not being there) the family type is patrilocal. Conversely, when the husband moves to live with his wife's mother's family, the famil y type is matrilocal. P atrilocal residence is the most comm on in India; examples of matrilocal residence are found am ong the Khasi, the Nayar, and several other matrilineal groups. In a number of tribal groups a neolocal residence (a new house for the newly wedded couple) is preferred, although it is more commo n for them to set up a new home after a period of stay in a partilocal or matrilocal setting. In Lakshadweep and central Kerala the approved pattern of residence is duolocal the husband continuing to live in his mother's Tarawad and the wife in her mother's Tarawad. India is often described as a country of joint famil ies. In social anthropological and sociological literature this term is less comm only used; a d istinction is made between the nuclear and extended family - the latter signifying units commonly referred to as the joint famil y. A nuclear famil y means a married couple and their children. An extended family, on the other hand is a larger group composed of two, three, or more generations of lineally related member their spouses, and children. In matrilineal extended famil ies the husbands of marri ed women are not included. At a given point of time the proportion of nuclear famil ies is higher, but most nuclear families grow into extended famil ies and break up later into incomplete extended families or nuclear famil ies. It is rare to find all or even most, members of two or three generations living together. There are evident limits to the number of persons sharing the same house; domestic discord often leads to the setting up of separate units. The latter are referred to as domestic groups of households.

They gradually come to have separate hearths (chulhas) and have independent arrangements for cooking and dining A form of jointness is maintained where nuclear families live and w ork separately, but where there is no formal division of ancestral property, all the members congregate on occasions of marri age and death as well as important ceremonial occasions, Togetherness and solidarity within the famil y are much lauded virtues, but households are not without their politics and intractable problems. Kinship denotes to recognition of relatives either through a blood relationship (technically ca lled consanguinity) or through marriage (in the language of anthropology and sociology called affinity) The relatives, as a class, have a special status; as already n oted, elaborate rules provide appropriate attitudes and stand ards of behavior towards them. These rules cover protection, affection care and concern, familiarity (joking relations), avoidance (of physical, s peech, or visual contact), deference, respect, intervention, and obedience. Kinship also has important social, economic, and political roles. The assertion that in modern industrial society the centrality of kinship has been eroded is, at best only partially correct. The entire range of kinship ties may not now be as important as they once used to be, but it cannot be denied that they have an important supportive or corrective role in social, economic, and political spheres.

This is called patrilineal descent. There are also matrilineal societies Garo, Khasi and Pahadi in the northeast, and Nayar, Mappilla, Lakshadweep islanders, and several tribal and 'nontribal groups in south India in which descent is traced in the mother's line. Besides these two main systems, there are also examples of cognatic communities- Anglo-Indians and some tribal groups which have bilateral tendencies. They may take the name from the father but in tracing descent they also take note of the mother's line. Alongside the words patrilineal and matrilineal, there is a tendency to use also Patriarchal and Matriarchal. The latter usage is loose and confusing. Patriarchy refers to male dominant structures and this indeed is the norm in a sizeable part of Indian society. But matriarchy (female dominant system) does not exist. Women in matrilineal groups are important but in several fields they are not the effective decision makers. Major management functions are vested in male members. There is considerable variation in pattern of residence after marri age. When the wife moves to live in her husband's father's house (or grandfather's or uncle's house, in the event of father not being there) the family type is patrilocal. Conversely, when the husband moves to live with his wife's mother's family, the famil y type is matrilocal. P atrilocal residence is the most comm on in India; examples of matrilocal residence are found am ong the Khasi, the Nayar, and several other matrilineal groups. In a number of tribal groups a neolocal residence (a new house for the newly wedded couple) is preferred, although it is more commo n for them to set up a new home after a period of stay in a partilocal or matrilocal setting. In Lakshadweep and central Kerala the approved pattern of residence is duolocal the husband continuing to live in his mother's Tarawad and the wife in her mother's Tarawad. India is often described as a country of joint famil ies. In social anthropological and sociological literature this term is less comm only used; a d istinction is made between the nuclear and extended family - the latter signifying units commonly referred to as the joint famil y. A nuclear famil y means a married couple and their children. An extended family, on the other hand is a larger group composed of two, three, or more generations of lineally related member their spouses, and children. In matrilineal extended famil ies the husbands of marri ed women are not included. At a given point of time the proportion of nuclear famil ies is higher, but most nuclear families grow into extended famil ies and break up later into incomplete extended families or nuclear famil ies. It is rare to find all or even most, members of two or three generations living together. There are evident limits to the number of persons sharing the same house; domestic discord often leads to the setting up of separate units. The latter are referred to as domestic groups of households.

They gradually come to have separate hearths (chulhas) and have independent arrangements for cooking and dining A form of jointness is maintained where nuclear families live and w ork separately, but where there is no formal division of ancestral property, all the members congregate on occasions of marri age and death as well as important ceremonial occasions, Togetherness and solidarity within the famil y are much lauded virtues, but households are not without their politics and intractable problems. Kinship denotes to recognition of relatives either through a blood relationship (technically ca lled consanguinity) or through marriage (in the language of anthropology and sociology called affinity) The relatives, as a class, have a special status; as already n oted, elaborate rules provide appropriate attitudes and stand ards of behavior towards them. These rules cover protection, affection care and concern, familiarity (joking relations), avoidance (of physical, s peech, or visual contact), deference, respect, intervention, and obedience. Kinship also has important social, economic, and political roles. The assertion that in modern industrial society the centrality of kinship has been eroded is, at best only partially correct. The entire range of kinship ties may not now be as important as they once used to be, but it cannot be denied that they have an important supportive or corrective role in social, economic, and political spheres. Rules of descent, residence, and inheritance have been discussed in the context of the family. Further elaboration of them will be tedious and only of academic interest. It is necessary, however, to distinguish between the broad features of kinship in northern and southern India and to comment briefly on some special cases.

The first two are exogamous, but the jati is endogamous. A man is not expected to marry in the Gotra of his father, mother, father's mother and mother's mother. Identity, Status, and property are transmitted in the male line. Members of the lineage cooperate in rituals and ceremonies, and indeed, in some major economic activities. But the group can also be characterized by conflicts and feuds th at may run from generation to generation. On specified occasions there is an exchange of gifts among different categories of kin and affines, but there is so much local, regional, and jati variation on this matter that it is impossible even to sketch them in a brief narrative. The most important feature here is that, among those who are closely related, marri age is strictly prohibited. The rule of village/territorial exogamy, in some parts, further distances the bride from the bridegroom. The roles of daughters and daughters-in- law are sharply distinguished. In south India the general features are the same, with some important exceptions. Here, patrilineages figure in some commu nities, while matrilineages dominate others. In the latter the mother's brother is the manager and exercises authority. As we have already seen in several groups the preferred unions are those between certain categories of close kincross cousins or a maternal uncle and niece, the latter being a daughter of the man's elder sister. The bride in these cases is famili ar with the family into which she is being married Thus unlike in the north w here bridetakers are superior to b ridegivers, no difference is made between the two in the south. These unions have some definite advant ages; apart from the fact that property rotates between sets of close kin and does not go outside the brides in such a setting are less likely to be illtreated than those in the north, where they are on unfamili ar terrain. In the end let us consider some special cases that puzzle outsiders. In descent, inheritance, and succession, as mentioned earlier, the Khasi of Meghalaya are matrilineal. They have matrilocal residence. In their inheritance system, the youngest daughter- the Kakhadduh- is very speci al: she is the heiress. While the other daughters move out after their marri ages and the birth of one or two children to set up separate household, the youngest daughter continues to live with her mother along with her husband and children. She is the custodian of the rituals and bones of iing (the house). She has a special position in regard to the land. Among the Garo the household is known as the Nok. The daughter chosen to inherit the household and continue it is cal led the Nokma. She has to marry someone from her father's lineage. Her husband is known as a Nokrmo . He inherits the headship (and through it the management) of his wife's Nok after the death of his father-in-law. But before he can do so he has to marry his wife's mother. This is essentially an economic arrangement. It is debatable whether this marriage (between the man and his wife's mother) is ever consummated, but some anthropologists are emphatic that sexual relations do take place between them. The pattern of duolocal residence and visiting husbands in central Kerala in the past, and in the Lakshadweep islands even now, may seem somewhat bizarre to outsiders, but it has worked and is still working. Nayar women could have Nambudiri or Nayar visiting husbands. Distance being long, Nayar husbands could Page | 3 SOCIOLO GY BY PRANAY AGGARW AL IAS GURUKUL Call 99996 937 44 www.ias gurukul.com 7, Basement, Apsara Arcade, near Karol Bagh Metro Station Gate # 7, Karol Bagh, New Delhi not make it to their wives every night, but the Nambudiris had a special privilege. Where land was not in short supply, a Math (residential place) was built for them near the Nayar Tarawad, preferably by the side of a pond or a well. The Nambudiri could not dine with his Nayar wife and children and did not have any physical contact with them during hi s daylong state of ritual purity. In the night he could be affectionate to his children and intimate with his wife. The pattern of duolocal residence still works in the Lakshadweep Island. In kalapani, an island in this group, studied in 196163, 76 percent of the unions were of this type. The island being small, distances to be traversed are manageable and this facilitates the working of the system.

There are also matrilineal societies Garo, Khasi and Pahadi in the northeast, and Nayar, Mappilla, Lakshadweep islanders, and several tribal and 'nontribal groups in south India in which descent is traced in the mother's line. Besides these two main systems, there are also examples of cognatic communities- Anglo-Indians and some tribal groups which have bilateral tendencies. They may take the name from the father but in tracing descent they also take note of the mother's line. Alongside the words patrilineal and matrilineal, there is a tendency to use also Patriarchal and Matriarchal. The latter usage is loose and confusing. Patriarchy refers to male dominant structures and this indeed is the norm in a sizeable part of Indian society. But matriarchy (female dominant system) does not exist. Women in matrilineal groups are important but in several fields they are not the effective decision makers. Major management functions are vested in male members. There is considerable variation in pattern of residence after marri age. When the wife moves to live in her husband's father's house (or grandfather's or uncle's house, in the event of father not being there) the family type is patrilocal. Conversely, when the husband moves to live with his wife's mother's family, the famil y type is matrilocal. P atrilocal residence is the most comm on in India; examples of matrilocal residence are found am ong the Khasi, the Nayar, and several other matrilineal groups. In a number of tribal groups a neolocal residence (a new house for the newly wedded couple) is preferred, although it is more commo n for them to set up a new home after a period of stay in a partilocal or matrilocal setting. In Lakshadweep and central Kerala the approved pattern of residence is duolocal the husband continuing to live in his mother's Tarawad and the wife in her mother's Tarawad. India is often described as a country of joint famil ies. In social anthropological and sociological literature this term is less comm only used; a d istinction is made between the nuclear and extended family - the latter signifying units commonly referred to as the joint famil y. A nuclear famil y means a married couple and their children. An extended family, on the other hand is a larger group composed of two, three, or more generations of lineally related member their spouses, and children. In matrilineal extended famil ies the husbands of marri ed women are not included. At a given point of time the proportion of nuclear famil ies is higher, but most nuclear families grow into extended famil ies and break up later into incomplete extended families or nuclear famil ies. It is rare to find all or even most, members of two or three generations living together. There are evident limits to the number of persons sharing the same house; domestic discord often leads to the setting up of separate units. The latter are referred to as domestic groups of households.

They gradually come to have separate hearths (chulhas) and have independent arrangements for cooking and dining A form of jointness is maintained where nuclear families live and w ork separately, but where there is no formal division of ancestral property, all the members congregate on occasions of marri age and death as well as important ceremonial occasions, Togetherness and solidarity within the famil y are much lauded virtues, but households are not without their politics and intractable problems. Kinship denotes to recognition of relatives either through a blood relationship (technically ca lled consanguinity) or through marriage (in the language of anthropology and sociology called affinity) The relatives, as a class, have a special status; as already n oted, elaborate rules provide appropriate attitudes and stand ards of behavior towards them. These rules cover protection, affection care and concern, familiarity (joking relations), avoidance (of physical, s peech, or visual contact), deference, respect, intervention, and obedience. Kinship also has important social, economic, and political roles. The assertion that in modern industrial society the centrality of kinship has been eroded is, at best only partially correct. The entire range of kinship ties may not now be as important as they once used to be, but it cannot be denied that they have an important supportive or corrective role in social, economic, and political spheres. Rules of descent, residence, and inheritance have been discussed in the context of the family. Further elaboration of them will be tedious and only of academic interest. It is necessary, however, to distinguish between the broad features of kinship in northern and southern India and to comment briefly on some special cases.

The first two are exogamous, but the jati is endogamous. A man is not expected to marry in the Gotra of his father, mother, father's mother and mother's mother. Identity, Status, and property are transmitted in the male line. Members of the lineage cooperate in rituals and ceremonies, and indeed, in some major economic activities. But the group can also be characterized by conflicts and feuds th at may run from generation to generation. On specified occasions there is an exchange of gifts among different categories of kin and affines, but there is so much local, regional, and jati variation on this matter that it is impossible even to sketch them in a brief narrative. The most important feature here is that, among those who are closely related, marri age is strictly prohibited. The rule of village/territorial exogamy, in some parts, further distances the bride from the bridegroom. The roles of daughters and daughters-in- law are sharply distinguished. In south India the general features are the same, with some important exceptions. Here, patrilineages figure in some commu nities, while matrilineages dominate others. In the latter the mother's brother is the manager and exercises authority. As we have already seen in several groups the preferred unions are those between certain categories of close kincross cousins or a maternal uncle and niece, the latter being a daughter of the man's elder sister. The bride in these cases is famili ar with the family into which she is being married Thus unlike in the north w here bridetakers are superior to b ridegivers, no difference is made between the two in the south. These unions have some definite advant ages; apart from the fact that property rotates between sets of close kin and does not go outside the brides in such a setting are less likely to be illtreated than those in the north, where they are on unfamili ar terrain. In the end let us consider some special cases that puzzle outsiders. In descent, inheritance, and succession, as mentioned earlier, the Khasi of Meghalaya are matrilineal. They have matrilocal residence. In their inheritance system, the youngest daughter- the Kakhadduh- is very speci al: she is the heiress. While the other daughters move out after their marri ages and the birth of one or two children to set up separate household, the youngest daughter continues to live with her mother along with her husband and children. She is the custodian of the rituals and bones of iing (the house). She has a special position in regard to the land. Among the Garo the household is known as the Nok. The daughter chosen to inherit the household and continue it is cal led the Nokma. She has to marry someone from her father's lineage. Her husband is known as a Nokrmo . He inherits the headship (and through it the management) of his wife's Nok after the death of his father-in-law. But before he can do so he has to marry his wife's mother. This is essentially an economic arrangement. It is debatable whether this marriage (between the man and his wife's mother) is ever consummated, but some anthropologists are emphatic that sexual relations do take place between them. The pattern of duolocal residence and visiting husbands in central Kerala in the past, and in the Lakshadweep islands even now, may seem somewhat bizarre to outsiders, but it has worked and is still working. Nayar women could have Nambudiri or Nayar visiting husbands. Distance being long, Nayar husbands could Page | 3 SOCIOLO GY BY PRANAY AGGARW AL IAS GURUKUL Call 99996 937 44 www.ias gurukul.com 7, Basement, Apsara Arcade, near Karol Bagh Metro Station Gate # 7, Karol Bagh, New Delhi not make it to their wives every night, but the Nambudiris had a special privilege. Where land was not in short supply, a Math (residential place) was built for them near the Nayar Tarawad, preferably by the side of a pond or a well. The Nambudiri could not dine with his Nayar wife and children and did not have any physical contact with them during hi s daylong state of ritual purity. In the night he could be affectionate to his children and intimate with his wife. The pattern of duolocal residence still works in the Lakshadweep Island. In kalapani, an island in this group, studied in 196163, 76 percent of the unions were of this type. The island being small, distances to be traversed are manageable and this facilitates the working of the system.
